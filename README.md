# linkedin-jobs-scrapper
Choose any keywords and location (as in the original Linkedin Jobs tab) and have all jobs' info stored into a dataframe, including qualifications, number of applicants and full job description. Further automated analysis is to be done.


## Disclaimer:
The task at hands does not involve a significant number of consecutive requests to Linkedin, therefore one can easily escape having their requests blocked. However, Linkedin actually requires permission to crawl through the website. See https://www.linkedin.com/legal/crawling-terms and https://www.linkedin.com/robots.txt: both lead to "Please email whitelist-crawl@linkedin.com if you would like to apply for permission to crawl LinkedIn."
